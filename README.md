This SLURM batch job script (XAI_test.sh) was used to run a Python program on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, specifying job parameters like the job name, resource allocation, and email notifications. It then executed the Python file python_test.py. The Python script prepares a dataset, trains Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, and evaluates their performance. It also used LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret the models' predictions, revealing key factors like cholesterol and heart rate positively influencing health, while calcium intake and being male have a negative impact. The job was sent to Supercommiting Wales using Filezilla (SFTP)  while access to the clsters computer was through PUTTY.
