Leveraging-SLURM-for-High-Performance-Computing-in-Machine-Learning
This SLURM batch job script is used to run a Python program on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, specifying job parameters like the job name, resource allocation, and email notifications. It then executes the Python file python_test.py. The Python script prepares a dataset, trains Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models, and evaluates their performance. It also uses LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret the models' predictions, revealing key factors like cholesterol and heart rate positively influencing health, while calcium intake and being male have a negative impact.
